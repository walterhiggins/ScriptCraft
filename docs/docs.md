# ScriptCraftJS Documentation

The documentation for ScriptCraftJS is evolving. On one hand some of it is intended for young developers. On the other hand, some of the material is a little heavy for some age groups, and young developers usually just want to get into code and have fun with Minecraft ... not sit and read docs.

So at first, many of these docs might be considered more of a primer and a reference for mentors rather than for students (that includes parents and their children). Mentors might want to learn how things work with these docs, setup environments for learning, and then refer students back here to get more info on whatever interests them.

If we can do anything to improve specific docs for specific audiences, please post an enhancement request to the GitHub Issues section, or post a note in one of the public spaces.

For anyone inclined to read all of the documentation, it's been organized here in what seems to be a logical progressive order.

* [README][readme] : This is the initial project page with an introduction and some good information for getting started or upgrading.
* [Help][help] : Sources for help and information are probably the first and best things to know.
* [Installation][installdoc] : Includes upgrades.
* [Starting and Stopping your server][startstop] : Short but all related info is in one place.
* [Permissions][permdoc] : Usually one of the first topics that will come up, especially in a classroom or  code camp environment.
* [Dependencies][deps] : Not required but includes some background to explain "the big picture".
* [Young Person's Guide][yp] (YPG) to Programming in Minecraft : This is the real Getting Started guide.
* [Anatomy of a Plugin][anatomydoc] : A bit more specific to using the YPG info for actual coding of plugins.
* [API Reference][api] : The true guru will read through all of this. Includes **lots** of sample code.
* [Using Java APIs in JavaScript][javaapidoc] : The answer to most questions like "how do code into other plugins".
* [Frequently Asked Questions][faqdoc] : Now includes more FAQs.
* [Contributing][contrib] : How to help improve the code and docs of ScriptCraftJS itself.
* [UNInstallation][uninstalldoc] : The last thing that might need to be done.
