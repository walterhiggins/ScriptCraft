# Getting Help for ScriptCraftJS

Here is where you can get help for ScriptCraftJS:

* The [project documentation][docs] << really, read the docs...
* The [ScriptCraftJS.org website][website] will increasingly be a hub for the community and a source of all information.
* The [SpigotMC API docs][spigotapi] are valuable since ScriptCraft essentially wraps Spigot - your success with ScriptCraft depends on your understanding of Spigot, so this is a primary, daily resource for information.
* The [Google Group][scforum] has many users and developers who are anxious to help.
* The [Issues][repo] section at GitHub. Check to see if someone else has reported a problem before reporting it again. This is more for reporting problems with the software than for asking HowTo questions, but all questions are welcome. You are encouraged to look at the source code, to see what the code is doing, and to read the comments in the code.
* Visit the [Gitter Chatroom][gitchat] where you may get a live response to a question.
* Older but still valid info on [Walter's blog][blogw]
* To keep up with changes, see [Tony's blog][blogt] (click the #ScriptCraftJS tag to see more).
* Look at the files under /scriptcraft/modules to see available features, and to see how to code your own plugins. (In the source code, this is /src/main/js/modules.)
* Look under /scriptcraft/plugins/drone/contrib for features and examples contributed by others. (In the source code, this is /src/main/js/plugins/drone/contrib.)
* Look under /scriptcraft/examples for simple code examples. (In the source code, this is /src/main/js/plugins/examples.)
* [Facebook][facebook]
* [Twitter][twitter] : Use hashtags #Minecraft, [#ScriptCraftJS][hashscjs], and #JavaScript, and reference @ScriptCraftJS! Some people use [#minecraft and #scriptcraft][hashmcsc], so follow that too.
* [YouTube vids][youtube]
* Buy the Official ScriptCraft Book [A Beginner's Guide to Writing Minecraft Plugins in JavaScript][book] (<< they might be out, try [here][book2]). People who find this (kids and adults) love it, but note however that now some of it is out of date.
